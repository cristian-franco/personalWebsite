# Getting Started with SvelteKit

This is my first blog post! I decided to build my personal site using SvelteKit because it's modern, fast, and enjoyable to work with.

## Why SvelteKit?

- **Simple to learn**: The syntax feels natural if you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- **Great performance**: Compiles to vanilla JS, no heavy runtime
- **File-based routing**: Easy to organize pages

## Next Steps

I'm planning to write more about:
- Setting up deployment on Netlify
- Adding markdown support
- Styling tips

Stay tuned!
