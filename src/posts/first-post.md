# Cristian

Hi everyone! Cristian here! I've decided to start blogging and sharing my work and projects to a larger audience (1 is still larger than 0!).

## OK, but Who Are You?
My name is Cristian Franco, I'm a software engineer (kind of) in the food tech space, and I'm from Los Angeles!

My recent interests include:
- **Homelabbing**: Set up a Raspberry Pi with a few useful services!
- **Backend**: Recently been working on the backend at work!
- **Open Source**: Going to SCALE 23x this year!

## Non-Tech Related Interests
Tech can be all encompassing, so I try to stay up to date on my non-tech hobbies and interests! I'll try to write about these in my blog as well, including but not limited to:
- **Rap and RnB**
- **Horror Movies**
- **Video Games**

## Why should I care?

You don't have to! That's the best part! This is just a little window into my projects and personal life, and if any of it reaches anyone, I consider that as a win!

If anyone wants to connect, feel free to email me at cristianfranco.cf@gmail.com.
