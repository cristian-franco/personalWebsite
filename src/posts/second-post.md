# Why I Switched from React to Svelte

After building several projects in React, I decided to try Svelte for my personal blog. Here's what I discovered.

## The Learning Curve

React has a steeper learning curve with concepts like:
- JSX syntax
- useState and useEffect hooks
- Virtual DOM

Svelte feels more intuitive - it's closer to vanilla JavaScript.

## Performance

Svelte compiles away at build time, so there's no framework overhead in the browser. React ships the entire library to the client.

## Final Thoughts

Both are great tools. React is better for career opportunities, but Svelte is more fun for side projects.
